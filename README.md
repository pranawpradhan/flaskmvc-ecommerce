# flaskmvc-ecommerce
An extensive ecommerce website with a Python FlaskMVC and Oracle Database 11g backend and an HTML5, CSS3 (Bootstrap) and JavaScript (jQuery) frontend.
This was made as semester project of my Database Systems (DB) and Object Oriented Analysis and Design (OOAD) courses. This project is work in
progress and can be used as an extensive boilerplate when starting out an ecommerce website with Flask.
